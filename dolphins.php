            Dolphin is a common name of aquatic mammals within the infraorder Cetacea.
            Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m long and 50 kg Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m and 10 t killer whale.
            Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at 55.5 km/h. 
            Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. 
            They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and 
            is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. 
            Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths.
            They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.
            Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide.
