            Seabirds (also known as marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment.
            In general, seabirds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds do, but they
             invest a great deal of time in their young. 
            Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. 
            Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations,
             crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. 
            They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, 
            and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, 
            coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.
